        <h1>HTML & CSS</h1>
        <p>I have experience with HTML & CSS I started programming HTML and CSS since I was 15.<br>
            At first I started to build my own website with a lot of youtube tutorials and w3schools.<br>
            When i went to sintlucas we also needed to build our own website and thats when I learned a lot.<br>
            I learned how paddings work and a lot of CSS because thats the language that I find hard.<br>
            But now I've made a whole website on my own without any search on the internet which is pretty hard.
        </p>
        <h1>C#</h1>
        <p>I didn't know C# when I went to Sintlucas I have learned a lot about this language in school.<br>
            I started with some basic functions like if statements and eventualy do while loops.<br>
            I also learned methods, enumarators, switch case and a lot more.<br>
            I'm programming this language in visual studio because its easy to use and free.
        </p>
        <h1>Visual Studio (code)</h1>
        <p>This is a IDE (Integrated development environment) we use these for school.<br>
            This IDE allows us to program the things we want and then run them.<br>
            There are a lot more IDE's than we use but these are free and easy to use.<br>
            I use visual studio it mostly for C#, and visual studio code for HTML, CSS and Javascript
        </p>
        <h1>Unity</h1>
        <p>Unity is an environment we use to make games I've used this only for school.<br>
            In Unity you can use scripts written in C# to make your game do something.<br>
            You can easily play your own game in Unity which makes it easy to adjust your game.<br>
            Unity has a lot of assets that help us programmers making it easier to make our games.
        </p>
        <h1>Building PC's</h1>
        <p>In my free time I love to build PC's I've build my first computer with my uncle and grandpa.<br>
            After I've builded my first computer with my uncle I got a lot of interest in building pc's.<br>
            The parts in my pc are picked out by me and I've also builded the pc on my own.<br>
            What I would like to be able to do some day is programming my own computer how to work.
        </p>
        <h1>3D-printing</h1>
        <p>At my home I got a 3D-printer which I use for small projects.<br>
            Like printing a cool statue of a game I like or making things that are usefull for in my house.<br>
            what I also like to do is to add some things to my 3D printer I have an Ender 3 pro.<br>
            The ender 3 pro is a printer a lot of people have and its cheap so you can take it as a starter.<br>
            I can also modify my printer because a lot of people builded some little add ons. <br>
            With my printer I can print PLA, ABS and ninjaflex the last one is very fun to play with
        </p>
